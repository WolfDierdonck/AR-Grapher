# AR Grapher
A mobile app to graph 3D mathematical functions in Augmented Reality (idea from @aadityayadav).

## About
Using conventional graphing technology such as websites, visualizing 3D mathematical functions can be difficult. The AR Grapher mobile app makes it possible for users to interact with the graph and fully visualize it from all angles.

## Installation
This mobile app was created in Unity, using the Vuforia engine for the AR compoment. To make any changes to this project, download Unity version 2019.4.3f1 and import the project.

The app can be downloaded from the Play Store here. (link required)

## Roadmap
Some possible features that could be added in the future are:

* Allow for additional types of functions such as piece-wise functions.
* Allow for non-functions to be graphed aswell (spheres, etc).
* Allow for variables to be defined and then used in functions.
